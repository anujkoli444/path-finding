# Pac-Man Path Finder Visualizer

## Overview
The Pac-Man Path Finder Visualizer is a web application designed to help visualize pathfinding algorithms, specifically A* and Dijkstra's algorithms, in a grid-based maze environment. Users can interact with the maze, select an algorithm, and visualize the pathfinding process in real-time.

## Features
- **Interactive Maze**: Users can create and reset the maze by clicking on the grid cells.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Choose between A* and Dijkstra's algorithms to visualize the pathfinding process.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch as the chosen algorithm finds the shortest path through the maze.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
  
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pacman-pathfinder-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pacman-pathfinder-visualizer
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### Usage
- Click on the grid cells to toggle walls and pathways.
- Select your preferred pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Click the "Start Pathfinding" button to visualize the algorithm finding a path.
- Click the "Reset Maze" button to clear the maze and start over.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the application.
- **styles.css**: The stylesheet for styling the maze and controls.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the pathfinding algorithms and user interactions.
